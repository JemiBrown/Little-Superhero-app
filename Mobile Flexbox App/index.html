        <p class="mobile-layout-paragraph">You are a force, a life changer, unstoppable, and one of the most amazing things in my world. Everyone who knows you, loves you.</p>
        <p class="mobile-layout-paragraph">You are the absolute best parts of me, my soul was shattered and you loved me while I picked those pieces up and learned that it was possible to rebuild myself into something better. Everything I have now is because of you.</p>
        <p class="mobile-layout-paragraph">We are breaking generational curses together, we are healing mother wounds and father wounds and going to leave this world better than we found it.</p>
        <p class="mobile-layout-paragraph">You are so small but you have already changed this world just as God intended. I love you. I am forever rejoicing and praising the Lord that I get to be your mom.</p>
        <p class="mobile-layout-paragraph">You are my little SuperHero in disguise. I want to build a life around you that is deserving of you. Give you everything you gave me and more.</p>
